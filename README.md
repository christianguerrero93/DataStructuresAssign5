# DataStructuresAssign5

 In this assignment you will be adding functionality to the BinarySearchTree class that we worked on in class.

You will also be writing a driver to test the BinarySearchTree.
Details

    TreeItem Class

    You will be using the TreeItem class that we implemented in class. The class may be downloaded from TreeItem.java
    TreeNode Class

    You will be using the TreeNode class that we implemented in class. The class may be downloaded from TreeNode.java
    TreeException Class

    You will be using the TreeException class that we implemented in class. The class may be downloaded from TreeException.java
    TreeIterator Class

    You will be using the TreeIterator class that we implemented in class. The class may be downloaded from TreeIterator.java
    BinarySearchTree Class

    You will be expanding the functionality of the BinarySearchTree class that we implemented in class. The class may be downloaded from BinarySearchTree.java

    you will be adding the following methods to the BinarySearchTree:
        public int height()
        private int treeHeight(TreeNode node)
        public boolean isBalanced()
        private boolean isBalancedSubtree(TreeNode node)
        public void balance()
        private TreeNode balanceTree(TreeItem[] arr, int first, int last)
    Driver Class

    You will write the Driver.java class which will implement the Driver Interface. The interface may be downloaded from DriverInterface.java.
    Test Cases

    You will be instantiating a BinarySearchTree<Integer,String> with TreeItem<Integer,String> objects. Your tree will be expected to properly handle the following test cases:
        Create 131,071 TreeItem<Integer,String> objects randomly generated. Save all your randomly generated TreeItem<Integer,String> objects in a Vector<TreeItem<Integer,String>>.
        Insert all your TreeItem<Integer,String> objects into the BinarySearchTree<Integer,String>.
        Measure the height of the BinarySearchTree<Integer,String>.
        Balance the BinarySearchTree<Integer,String>.
